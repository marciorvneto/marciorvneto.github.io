Hello, welcome to my site. My name is Márcio Vianna, I'm a Chemical Engineer from Brazil who's always enjoyed working with computers.
I have a dual doctoral degree in mathematical modeling and simulation, and I've been working in the intersection of engineering and computer science
for over ten years.

I'm also the founder and developer of [Voima Toolbox](https://voimatoolbox.com), a web platform enabling engineers to perform calculations. It's been growing quite well,
reaching over 2.5k organic clicks on Google per month, and has around 3k registered engineers and technicians.

I've done a lot of consulting, where have either developed custom _chemical process simulators_, or helped teams develop their own.

I also work with and teach AI at a post-graduate level at a local university (more specifically, _reinforcement learning_). Recently, I've helped a small
logistics company leverage their largely unused history dataset to more accurately predict routing prices using AI.

Here's a more detailed drilldown of my resume:

## 1. Professional & Academic Background

- **Chemical Engineer** with a dual-PhD in **Mathematical Modeling** (UFMG, Brazil) and **Energy Systems** (LUT University, Finland), plus a Master’s in **Mathematical Modeling and Optimization**.
- Extensive expertise in **process simulation, optimization,** and **computational frameworks** for the engineering sector.

## 2. Voima Toolbox

- **Founder/Developer** of **[Voima Toolbox](https://voimatoolbox.com)**, a web platform enabling engineers to perform calculations, manage projects, and build workflows via a **node editor**.
- [Voima Toolbox](https://voimatoolbox.com) also has a free-to-use version, which helps engineers perform common, and often tricky, standalone calculations.
- Currently counts with close to **3,000 registered engineers and technicians**, with **2,500+ monthly Google clicks**—rapidly growing user base and industry adoption.

Comparing Dec/2024 with Jan/2024, we've experienced an amazing
2400% (yes, twenty four hundred percent) growth in organic Google clicks!

## 3. Process Simulators

Chemical process simulation and optimization are really the bread and butter of my consulting practice, and I've

- Collaborated with an IT company to **design and implement** a comprehensive **steady-state chemical process simulator** for the **oil and gas** sector.
- The simulator is now in **production**, actively used by one of the **world’s largest oil companies**—a testament to its industrial-grade reliability.
- Currently developing a series of custom steady-state simulators for a large mining company.

## 4. Computer Vision for Process Control

- Built a **computer vision system** for a process control company that **analyzes and measures particle sizes** in **mining plants**, improving real-time monitoring and control.
- Helped streamline **quality control** and reduce downtime in high-throughput industrial environments.

## 5. Industrial HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces)

- **Developed and deployed** multiple **Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs)** in the **mining industry**, enhancing operational visibility and control across complex process setups.

## 6. Transient-State Water Hammer Simulator

- Created a **transient-state water hammer simulator** used for **risk assessment** and **prevention** in **major Brazilian water supply pipelines**—helping avoid catastrophic pipeline failures and improve infrastructure resilience.
