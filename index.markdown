## About Me

I hold a dual PhD in Mathematical Modeling (from [UFMG](https://ufmg.br), Brazil) and Energy Systems (from [LUT University](https://www.lut.fi/en), Finland), and I also have a Master’s in **Mathematical Modeling and Optimization**. My career has focused on creating impactful solutions at the intersection of engineering and IT.

I’m the founder of [Voima Toolbox](https://voimatoolbox.com), a platform that simplifies complex engineering calculations. Voima has grown steadily, drawing over 2.5k monthly visitors on Google and building a community of nearly 3k engineers and technicians.

My work has taken me across international teams and collaborations, equipping me with the skills to operate well in diverse, multicultural environments.

I have extensive expertise in **process simulation, optimization**, and in creating computational tools for the engineering sector.

Beyond my work, I’m a lifelong learner, constantly challenging myself with advanced courses in fields like AI, statistics, pure math, and numerical methods. I’ve earned a [MicroMasters from MIT](https://credentials.edx.org/credentials/cdd5c3bb0235440ca3ab8a0ead1c79d2/) in statistics and data science, further sharpening my skills.

I also teach AI (primarily reinforcement learning) at the post-graduate level. My projects include helping a logistics company harness historical data to predict routing prices more accurately and designing simulators for major industries like oil and chemicals.

## Highlights

- **International Expertise:** Worked with multicultural teams in Brazil, Finland, and beyond, gaining insights into global engineering challenges.
- **Process Simulators:** Developed tools for industries, including one used by a leading global oil company.
- **AI Solutions:** Built practical AI systems for logistics and process optimization, delivering measurable results.
- **Lifelong Learning:** Studied advanced topics independently, including earning an MIT MicroMasters in statistics and data science.
- **Education:** Taught AI to graduate students, mentoring the next generation of engineers and data scientists.
